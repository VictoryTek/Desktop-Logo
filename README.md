# Desktop Logo Applet for COSMIC

Simple COSMIC desktop applet (prototype) that overlays a logo on top of the current wallpaper, inspired by Fedora's `background-logo` extension. Project name: Desktop Logo.

## Status
- Core image compositing implemented.
- Applet crate provides configuration loading (`desktop-logo.toml`).
- Flatpak manifest & desktop file placeholders included.
- Pending: Real libcosmic integration (currently stubbed until stable API details).

## Workspace Layout
```
Cargo.toml (workspace)
crates/
  applet/ -> Applet logic + config loader + overlay rendering
assets/   -> Placeholder images (replace with real ones)
desktop-logo.toml -> Applet configuration
flatpak/com.example.CosmicLogoApplet.json -> Flatpak manifest (prototype)
data/com.example.CosmicLogoApplet.desktop -> Desktop file stub
```

## Building
Ensure you have a recent stable Rust toolchain installed.

```
cargo build --workspace
```

## Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built Flatpak (Recommended)

1. **Download from GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/VictoryTek/Desktop-Logo/actions) of this repository
   - Find the latest successful workflow run
   - Download the `desktop-logo-applet-flatpak` artifact
   - Extract the `desktop-logo-applet.flatpak` file

2. **Install the Flatpak:**
   ```bash
   # Install the downloaded bundle
   flatpak install --user desktop-logo-applet.flatpak
   
   # Run the applet
   flatpak run com.example.CosmicLogoApplet
   ```

### Option 2: Build and Install Locally

1. **Prerequisites:**
   ```bash
   # Install required tools
   sudo apt install flatpak flatpak-builder
   
   # Add Flathub remote for base runtime
   flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
   flatpak install --user flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//23.08 org.freedesktop.Sdk//23.08
   ```

2. **Clone and build:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VictoryTek/Desktop-Logo.git
   cd Desktop-Logo
   
   # Use the build script
   chmod +x scripts/build-flatpak.sh
   ./scripts/build-flatpak.sh
   
   # Install the generated bundle
   flatpak install --user desktop-logo-applet.flatpak
   ```

### Managing the Installation

```bash
# Check if installed
flatpak list --user | grep CosmicLogoApplet

# Run the applet
flatpak run com.example.CosmicLogoApplet

# Uninstall if needed
flatpak uninstall --user com.example.CosmicLogoApplet
```

## Configuration
Edit `desktop-logo.toml`:
```
logo_path = "assets/logo.png"
position = "BottomRight"  # TopLeft | TopRight | BottomLeft | BottomRight
margin = 64
max_logo_percent = 0.18
opacity = 0.85
```
The applet loads this file at startup (future: path may become XDG config). If `desktop-logo.toml` is missing, the applet will error out; a future enhancement may add default generation.

## Positions
Use: `tl`, `tr`, `bl`, `br` for Top/Bottom + Left/Right.

## Future COSMIC Integration
When libcosmic (and COSMIC desktop APIs) expose a background overlay or desktop-layer interface, the applet can:
1. Subscribe to wallpaper/display change events.
2. Recalculate scaling for multi-monitor setups.
3. Use per-output surfaces for proper placement.

Planned enhancements:
- Configurable scaling modes (relative to width/height separately)
- Optional caching
- SVG logo rendering (using `resvg` or similar)
- Multi-monitor awareness
- Dynamic recoloring

## Testing
```
cargo test --workspace
```

## Flatpak Development

The project includes Flatpak packaging for distribution. The manifest `flatpak/com.example.CosmicLogoApplet.json` uses the Freedesktop runtime (will switch to COSMIC runtime when available).

Note: The applet currently renders an overlay inside an applet window (not modifying the wallpaper file directly).

## Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)
A workflow `.github/workflows/flatpak.yml` builds the Flatpak on each push/PR to `main` or `master`:
1. Checks out code.
2. Installs stable Rust.
3. Caches Cargo artifacts.
4. Runs `flatpak-builder` to build & install the applet into a local user repository.
5. Exports a bundle artifact `desktop-logo-applet.flatpak` you can sideload.

To trigger manually, use the workflow dispatch event in GitHub's Actions UI.

## Disclaimer
Assets are placeholders. Replace with real wallpaper/logo images. Flatpak packaging and libcosmic integration are stubs pending upstream API stability.
